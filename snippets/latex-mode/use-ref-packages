% NOTE: varioref, hyperref, and cleveref must be loaded IN THAT ORDER.
% And hyperref generally wants to be the last thing loaded in your
% document (except for cleveref).

% varioref provides \vref, which makes references like "figure 1 on
% the next page" or "figure 2 on page 99" when the figure being
% referenced is not on the same page as the reference.
\\${1:$$(yas-choose-value '("usepackage" "RequirePackage"))}{varioref}

% hyperref should generally be loaded last.
\\$1{hyperref}

% cleveref automatically adds the type of the thing being referenced
% when you \cref, such as "figure 1" rather than just "1".  The
% noabbrev option keeps it from abbreviating the name of the type of
% thing being referenced, such as abbreviating "figure" to "fig."
% Note that loading this package will add this type-prefixing to
% varioref's \vref as well.
%
% Include nameinlink option if you want the "figure" to be a link as
% well as "1" in e.g. "figure 1."
%
% The nosort option prevents cleveref from turning
% "\cref{sec3,sec1,sec2}, respectively" into "sections 1, 2, and 3
% respectively."
%
% NOTE: This package must be loaded *after* hyperref and amsmath.
